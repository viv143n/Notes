# Notes
Variables
What is static binding ?
    Static binding is nothing but to define a variable in others languages like c++ and  java needs to define the type of variable example- int a = 5
    is a static binding .
What is Dynamic binding?
    Dyanamic binding is used in python while we can directly define the variable a = 5 or whatever we like python will automatically detect what type is it thats an Dynamic binding.
