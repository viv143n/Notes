### Static Binding & Dynamic Binding



## Static Binding (def data types to variable)
 Static binding is nothing but to define a variable in others languages like c++ and java needs to define the type of variable example- int
 a = 5 is a static binding . 
## Dynamic Binding (not def data types)
Dynamic binding is used in python while we can directly define the variable a = 5 or whatever we like python will automatically detect what type is it thats an Dynamic binding.
